# NS2_Routing_Simulation

The C++ code is executed using NS2 simulator and wireshark is used to capture the pcap files. The csv files generated at eacch simulation Node are parsed through the python parser to get the distacne between the nodes and their virtual location. To calculate the delay between the transmission and receiving delay program is used.

The C++ NS2 code mainly discuss about three types of routing:

1) DSR
2) DSDV
3) AODV
